# Visitor rank

## Problem

There can be high number of online visitors online. The sales agents want to approach the visitors with highest potential. We need to order the online visitors based on their *interestingness* to the agents.

## Solution

We record events for different actions that the visitors take on the page. Visitors can also themselves contact the sales agents. Based on this data we rank the visitors and update the ordering of the *online visitors list*.
